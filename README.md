## Pending Task Items
 - Migrate Fontello Icons to Fontastic Font Icons
 - Assets - Need to be automatically copied to dist folder. Currently it is manual. 
 - Need to check what is code coverage metrics
 - For the entire component library, we will be skipping the CSS testing for now. Can be taken up later. Mostly it is relevant to atom components.

##Developer Guidelines
- **Naming Conventions:**
	- Variables
    	Interface: **I[Name]** or **I[Name]Props**. E.g.: IBoxProps, IButtonProps, etc
		Types: **t[Name]**. E.g.: tDisplay, tColor, tBgColor, etc.
	
	- Files
		Components: index.tsx
		Stories: xxx.stories.tsx
		Unit Tests: xxx.test.tsx
	
- **Before Raising Merge Requests:**
	- Make sure all your components are exported as part of the library in index.tsx
	
	- Storybook
		- Component should be listed appropriately in atoms, molecules or organisms folder.
		- Component should have knobs.
		- Component should have actions if User Interaction is possible.
		- Component source code should be visible in Story source tab.
		- Props details should be shown appropriately in Docs section.
	
	- Testing
		- Component should have .test.tsx files
		- Use `npm run test` or `npm run test:watch` to ensure no existing tests are failing.
